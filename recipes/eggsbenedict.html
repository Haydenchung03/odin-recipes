    <ul class = "ullist">
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3½ tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>
        <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class = "ostitle">Steps</h3>
    <ol class = "ollist">
        <li>To Make Hollandaise: Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.</li>
        <li>Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven on broiler setting. To Poach Eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate</li>
        <li>While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.</li>
        <li>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</li>
